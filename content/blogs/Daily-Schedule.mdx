Here’s how I balance contributing to open source, learning ML, and building during hackathons — with a daily schedule.

---

This isn’t one of those picture-perfect routines with sunrise yoga and bulletproof coffee.

This is the **“barely surviving, lowkey thriving”** kind of schedule — where C++ pointers haunt me, my ML notebooks have more `TODO:` than code, and I switch between blockchain docs and GitHub issues at 2:47 AM like it’s a personality trait.

## 🔧 C++ + DSA

Sometime after I wake up (if I slept), I crack open LeetCode or Codeforces.

Half the time I stare at a problem for an hour and then realize I forgot how binary search works. But hey — we move.

Sometimes I write code that compiles on the first try. Those are the days I believe in magic.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning

I *try* to learn ML every day.

Sometimes that means implementing gradient descent from scratch. Other times it means opening a Jupyter notebook, typing `import numpy`, and then watching a YouTube video about Transformers until I fall asleep with my laptop still on.

But honestly, it's progress. The goal is not perfection — it's just showing up.

## 🌐 Open Source & Blockchain

At some point, I get inspired to contribute.

I clone random repos, fix typos, file issues, and once in a while — actually submit a real PR that gets merged.  
On better days, I’m deep in smart contract dev: Solana programs, Anchor, Rust errors that make no sense — the usual.

Sometimes I learn more in 20 minutes debugging a bug than in 2 hours of tutorials.

---

## 🚀 Hackathons, Side Projects, and Chaos

This is my favorite part.

It’s messy, spontaneous, and borderline chaotic.  
I throw together whatever I’ve learned — ML models, blockchain infra, random open-source packages — and try to ship something cool.

The deadlines are fake but the pressure is real.

---

## 🧘‍♂️ The Wind-Down That Doesn’t Happen

Ideally, I journal and reflect at night.

Realistically, I scroll through GitHub stars, fork some repos I’ll never touch again, and fall asleep halfway through reading a paper.

---

## 🛠 Tools That Make Me Feel Productive

- **VSCode** (with too many extensions)
- **JupyterLab** (open in 5 tabs, none finished)
- **GitHub CLI** (because I like feeling like a hacker)
- **Notion / Obsidian** (organized chaos)

---

If you’re trying to balance ML, open source, and blockchain too — don’t stress about perfect routines. Just keep showing up. Even if it’s at 3 AM.

We’re all just trying our best out here.
