A bonding curve is a mathematical function that defines the relationship between the price and supply of a token. It's a key concept in decentralized finance (DeFi) and plays a crucial role in automating pricing and liquidity mechanisms for tokens1.

How Bonding Curves Work: Price Determination: When a user wants to buy tokens, the smart contract calculates the current price based on the existing supply. As tokens are purchased, they are minted, increasing the supply and subsequently raising the price for the next buyer1.

Supply and Demand: Bonding curves automate the market-making process by creating a direct relationship between supply and demand. This ensures constant liquidity, as there's always a price at which tokens can be bought or sold1.

Curve Shapes: The shape of the bonding curve influences how aggressively the price responds to changes in supply. Different curves can be designed to suit specific economic behaviors and project goals1.

Applications in DeFi: Automated Market Makers (AMMs): Bonding curves form the backbone of many AMMs, such as Raydium, which use constant product formulas to maintain liquidity in trading pairs.

Token Issuance: Bonding curves are used in ICOs and continuous token issuance, ensuring a fair and transparent pricing mechanism.

Benefits: Limitless Supply: There is no limit to the number of tokens that can be minted.

Deterministic Price Calculation: The price of tokens increases and decreases according to the number of tokens minted.

Continuous Price: The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more than token n-1.

Immediate Liquidity: Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any time.

Bonding curves offer a mathematical approach to defining the relationship between token supply and price, enabling efficient and transparent market operations. They are a powerful tool in the DeFi ecosystem, facilitating decentralized trading and token issuance.
