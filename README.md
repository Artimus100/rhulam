Welcome to the personal portfolio repository of Artimus100, a passionate and innovative software developer specializing in decentralized applications, blockchain technologies, and full-stack development. This repo showcases a collection of projects that reflect deep technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a commitment to building impactful software solutions.

## About Me
I am a tech enthusiast driven by the power of blockchain and decentralized technologies to create meaningful change. With hands-on experience in Rust, Solana, Next.js, and Web3, I focus on cutting-edge projects like decentralized carbon credit marketplaces, tokenization of real-world assets, and scalable NFT/SFT platforms.

Experienced in building smart contracts using Anchor and Rust on Solana.

Proficient in modern frontend frameworks, including Next.js (app router) with MDX for rich content rendering.

Passionate about climate tech, demonstrated through projects that tokenize carbon credits and enable fractional ownership.

Strong background in designing and developing scalable backend APIs and blockchain integrations.

Open source contributor and hackathon enthusiast aiming to solve real-world problems with technology.

## Featured Projects
